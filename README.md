# go-jwlm
A utility to merge multiple JW Library backup files, written in Go

This is a hobby project and still a WIP. My intention is to 
write a CLI tool that helps me keep the libraries on my iPad
and iPhone in sync, while I'm adding or tweaking notes or marks
on both devices. At the same time its a oportunity to improve
my skills in Go programming. Lets see how that will turn out..
